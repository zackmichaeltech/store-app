Django online store

Testing log in functionality: 
For security purposes each person using this webapp needs to configure his/her own smtp settings, for now only an EMAIL_BACKEND using django console handles that, but
there are commented out lines in settigns.py waitign to be filled with proper data; 

IN ORDER TO TEST log in functionality: 1. register and account , log in to admin, set newly created account status to ACTIVE(it's default is INACTIVE), 
from now on you can log in with a newly created account
